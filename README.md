The focus of this study is on the state of Madhya Pradesh, from the NSSO data, to find the top and bottom three consuming districts of Madhya Pradesh. In the process, we manipulate and clean the dataset to get the required data to analyze. To facilitate this analysis, we have gathered a dataset containing consumption-related information, including data on rural and urban sectors, as well as district-wise variations. The dataset has been imported into R, a powerful statistical programming language renowned for its versatility in handling and analyzing large datasets.

Our objectives include identifying missing values, addressing outliers, standardizing district and sector names, summarizing consumption data regionally and district-wise, and testing the significance of mean differences. The findings from this study can inform policymakers and stakeholders, fostering targeted interventions and promoting equitable development across the state.
